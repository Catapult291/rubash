//! Build script (rubash#488): capture the git revision the binary was built
//! from so `--version` can append a `build: <hash> (<profile>)` traceability
//! line. Builds without git (source tarballs, sandboxed checkouts) report
//! "unknown".
//!
//! rubash#827, recommendation 3: a bare HEAD hash does not guarantee content
//! — the v1.4.0 incident shipped a banner naming a commit whose tree the
//! binary did not match (the build compiled HEAD plus uncommitted edits).
//! A tree with uncommitted changes therefore stamps `<rev>-dirty-<8 hex>`
//! where the digest names WHICH uncommitted state was compiled: same edits,
//! same digest; anything else changes the banner.
//!
//! The explicit `RUBASH_BUILD_HASH` pin cannot launder a dirty tree either.
//! The pin is read crate-side via `option_env!` (see build_info.rs) — it
//! wins only the revision half; this script emits the worktree's dirty
//! half under its own `RUBASH_GIT_DIRTY_SUFFIX` name, and a pinned hash
//! still gains `-dirty[-<digest>]` whenever the tree is dirty.
